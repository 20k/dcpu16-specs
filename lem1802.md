# Description

The LEM1802 is a 128x96 pixel low energy monitor, supporting a palette of 16 12-bit colours. The display is divided up into 32x12 cells, where each cell has a size of 4x8 pixels. Each cell can display one of 128 characters, with a separate foreground and background colour, selected from the palette of 16 colours. Both the palette, and characters to display are fully configurable. Video ram is 386 words long, containing 384 words of character data followed by 2 words of padding

# Internal Storage Specification

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| VIDEORAM_ADDRESS | If 0, the LEM1802 is off. If > 0, video ram is mapped to this address, and the device is switched on if not already. Going from off to on takes about 1 second, during which time interrupts are still processed. See Video Ram for more details |
| FONTRAM_ADDRESS | If 0, the default font is used. If > 0, font data is instead read from this address. See Font Ram for more details |
| PALETTE_ADDRESS | If 0, the default colour palette is used. If > 0, palette data is instead read from this address. See Palette Ram for more details |
| BORDER_COLOR | Palette index of the colour to set the border to |

# Specification

Sending a hardware interrupt to this device via the HWI instruction does different things depending on the contents of the registers A and B

| Interrupt Name | A | B | Description |
| ---- |---|---:|------------|
| MEM_MAP_SCREEN   | 0 | 0   | VIDEORAM_ADDRESS is set to B, and the screen is switched off. See Video Ram for more details |
| MEM_MAP_SCREEN   | 0 | > 0 | VIDEORAM_ADDRESS is set to B. If the screen is off, it is switched on, taking about 1 second to warm up. See Video Ram for more details |
| MEM_MAP_FONT 	   | 1 | 0   | FONTRAM_ADDRESS is set to B, and the default font is used. See Font Ram for more details |
| MEM_MAP_FONT 	   | 1 | > 0 | FONTRAM_ADDRESS is set to B, and font data is read from this address. See Font Ram for more details |
| MEM_MAP_PALETTE  | 2 | 0   | PALETTE_ADDRESS is set to B, and the default colour palette is used. See Palette Ram for more details |
| MEM_MAP_PALETTE  | 2 | > 0 | PALETTE_ADDRESS is set to B, and palette data is read from this address. See Palette Ram for more details |
| SET_BORDER_COLOR | 3 | Any | BORDER_COLOR is set to (B & 0xF), representing a colour palette index |
| MEM_DUMP_FONT    | 4 | Any | Writes the contents of DEFAULT_FONT at the address stored in B. Takes 256 cycles to execute |
| MEM_DUMP_PALETTE | 5 | Any | Writes the contents of DEFAULT_PALETTE at the adddress stored in B. Takes 16 cycles to execute |

# Video Ram

Video Ram is an area of memory 386 words long, storing 384 (32x12) words of character data followed by 2 words of unused padding. There is no internal video ram storage, but instead an area of the main memory of the DCPU-16 is assigned to the LEM1802, starting at the address VIDEORAM_ADDRESS

The 384 words are structured as 32x12 cells. Each cell has the format:

	ffffbbbbBccccccc
	
ccccccc defines the character to display

B causes the character to blink slowly if set to 1

bbbb defines the background colour, as an index into the colour palette

ffff defines the foreground colour, as an index into the colour palette

# Font Ram

If FONTRAM_ADDRESS is > 0, a 256 word long region of memory is mapped which is used as the source of font data representing 128 characters, instead of the default font

Two words in font ram represent one character. The character Z might look as follows:

	word0 = 1100000110110001
	word1 = 1000110110000011

Alternatively: 

           |<---Y---|
                         -
    word0 = 11000001 \   |
            10110001     X
    word1 = 10001101 \   |
            10000011     v
                         -

This makes fully custom graphics possible if desired

# Palette Ram

If PALETTE_ADDRESS is > 0, a 16 word long region of memory is mapped which is used as the source of palette data, instead of the default palette

Each word in palette memory represents 1 colour, giving a possibility of 16 colours. The format of each entry is as follows:
    
	0000rrrrggggbbbb
	
Where r = red, g = green, and b = blue, in the sRGB color space. 0000111111111111 is white, and 0000000000000000 is black

# Example

This example assumes that the 0th device is the LEM1802

```
:start
HWQ 0         ; Not strictly necessary, gets info about hardware

SET A, 0      ; MEM_MAP_SCREEN
SET B, 0x8000 ; Will initialise the LEM and set the vram address

HWI 0         ; Command the LEM to turn on and maps vram to 0x8000, with A = 0, and B = 0x8000

SET Y, [data] ; Sets Y to the length of the string
SET Z, 0      ; Init loop counter

:display

SET C, [data + Z + 1]     ; Sets C to the character to be displayed
ADD C, 0b1111000000000000 ; Display character in white. Format is ffffbbbbBccccccc. Could also use BOR

SET [0x8000 + Z], C       ; Set the character in VRAM to display it

ADD Z, 1                  ; Next element of loop
IFN Z, Y                  ; Keep looping until all characters are displayed
SET PC, display           ; More characters to display

SET PC, start             ; Finished display loop, reset program

:data
.dat 12, "Hello World!"   ; prefix the string with the length of the string


```

# Addendum

Original spec located here: https://github.com/lucaspiller/dcpu-specifications/blob/master/lem1802.txt

Its unclear whether or not video ram is 386 words intentionally, or should just be 384 words
